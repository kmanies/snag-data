Data from AK and Canada of snag density over time

Recently done: Filled in density data. KLM notes: one weird point (>200% at age 4).
Fits done with density slightly better AIC than those done with basal area, but
not sure that they're really that much better. Will think about what the data 
means and do the reading when I get back from New Zealand.

TO DO:
* ~~Clean up repository and script~~
  ---KLM made script for density calcs to compare with basal area
  ---Did some preliminary clean up of script

* Do some reading - Tom Spies, Virginie Angers, etc.
  ---Added folder called papers where we can put relavant papers, added two

* Think about implications? E.g.: radiative forcing; CWD inputs; C dynamics

* Data to compare against

* KM to start writing methods
