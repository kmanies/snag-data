snag-data
=========
Data from AK and Canada of snag density over time


TO DO:
* Clean up repository and script
* Do some reading - Tom Spies, Virginie Angers, etc.
* Think about implications? E.g.: radiative forcing; CWD inputs; C dynamics
* Data to compare against
* Get raw #s - how many snags did we start with at each site?
* Fill in individual numbers (density in trees/ha along with BA)
