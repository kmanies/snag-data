snag-data
=========
Data from AK and Canada of snag density over time


TO DO:
* ~~Clean up repository and script~~
* Do some reading - Tom Spies, Virginie Angers, etc.
* Think about implications? E.g.: radiative forcing; CWD inputs; C dynamics
* Data to compare against
* Fill in density data (trees/ha along with BA)
* KM to start writing methods
