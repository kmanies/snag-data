Data from AK and Canada of snag density over time

Recently done: Filled in density data. KLM notes: one weird point (>200% at age 4).
Fits done with density slightly better AIC than those done with basal area, but
not sure that they're really that much better. Will think about what the data 
means and do the reading when I get back from New Zealand.

TO DO:
* ~~Clean up repository and script~~
  ---KLM included code for density calcs to compare with basal area
  ---Did some preliminary clean up of script

* Do some reading - Tom Spies, Virginie Angers, etc.
  ---See list started below

* Think about implications? E.g.: radiative forcing; CWD inputs; C dynamics

* Data to compare against

* KM to start writing methods

Boulanger & Sirois 2006. doi:10.1139/X06-070: Data from Quebec. "Moreover, fire-created
 snags, which decompose slowly, may remain standing for a long time (Wei et al., 1997; 
Tinkerand Knight 2000). As a result, it has been suggested that fire hampers the
decomposition of fire-killed trees (Wei and Kimmins 1998) and leads to the
formation of an important carbon reservoir in the boreal ecosystem (Kasischke 2000)."
"The fall rate for snags throughout the chronosequence followed a linear trend (R2=
0.992, p<0.001, Fig 2). ... 50% of snags would have fallen after 31.0 years.

followed negatvie exponential equation (k= 0.20/yr, high variability of 0.08-0.37).
Positively correlated with stand age, site windiness, and incidence of decay fungi or
insects.
