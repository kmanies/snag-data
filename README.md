snag-data
=========
Data from AK and Canada of snag density over time

Recently done: Filled in density data. KLM notes: one weird point (>200% at age 4).
Fits done with density slightly better AIC than those done with basal area, but
not sure that they're really that much better. Will think about what the data 
means and do the reading when I get back from New Zealand.

TO DO:
* ~~Clean up repository and script~~
  ---KLM included code for density calcs to compare with basal area
  ---Did some preliminary clean up of script

* Do some reading - Tom Spies, Virginie Angers, etc.
  ---See list started below

* Think about implications? E.g.: radiative forcing; CWD inputs; C dynamics

* Data to compare against

* KM to start writing methods

[Boulanger & Sirois 2006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X06-070): Data from Quebec. "Moreover, fire-created
 snags, which decompose slowly, may remain standing for a long time (Wei et al., 1997; 
Tinkerand Knight 2000). As a result, it has been suggested that fire hampers the
decomposition of fire-killed trees (Wei and Kimmins 1998) and leads to the
formation of an important carbon reservoir in the boreal ecosystem (Kasischke 2000)."
"The fall rate for snags throughout the chronosequence followed a linear trend (R2=
0.992, p<0.001, Fig 2). ... 50% of snags would have fallen after 31.0 years.

[Hogg and Michaelian 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12805): Follow aspen in W. Canada. Rates
followed negatvie exponential equation (k= 0.20/yr, high variability of 0.08-0.37).
Positively correlated with stand age, site windiness, and incidence of decay fungi or
insects.

[Storaunet and Rolstad 2002](http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X02-105): Norway spruce showed negative exponential distribution from death to fall, mean of 22 yrs, range of 0-91 yrs. All non-fire
deaths.

[Angers et al. 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.09.026): Degradation pathways were examined in four tree species of the eastern boreal mixedwood and conifer forests of Canada. Most species survival curves exhibited a reverse sigmoid function. Trembling aspen, jack pine and to a lesser extent balsam fir presented significant lag times before initiation of a period with high fall rates. Black spruce experienced more snag losses during the first years following death. Jack pine was clearly the most persistent species due to snags high resistance to fall and stem breakage. Within the range of tree diameters in our study area, diameter per se did not significantly influence fall probability.

[Angers et al. 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x11-167): Wood density and variables potentially influencing decay rates were measured on discs of 207 snags in northwestern Quebec, Canada. Mineralization rates varied significantly among species. Trembling aspen exhibited a more rapid rate of loss than conifers. Jack pine was the second most rapid species to lose wood density, followed by balsam fir. Black spruce was particularly resistant to mineralization, and its wood density was not significantly influenced by time elapsed since death.

[Hilger et al. 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-2277.1): Standing dead trees (snags) and downed woody debris contribute substantially to the carbon (C) budget of Canada's forest. Accurate parameterization of the C transfer rates (CTRs) from snags to downed woody debris is important for forest C dynamics models such as the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3), but CTRs are rarely measured or reported in the literature. We combined tree data from 10 802 sample plots and previously published species-specific individual-tree relationships between tree diameter (diameter at breast height, dbh) and fall rate to derive stand-level estimates of CTRs for the CBM-CFS3. We estimated CTRs and FRs and used the FR values to validate this approach by comparing them with standardized FR values compiled from the literature.

[Storaunet and Rolstad 2004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-248): We estimated time from death to fall of Norway spruce snags in a submountainous old-growth forest in south-central Norway, applying four calculation methods to 124 dendrochronologically cross-dated still-standing snags and 64 fallen logs. The calculation methods consistently estimated expected standing time of snags at 26–34 years, with a median of 16–21 years and 20% of snags standing for >48–58 years. The survival function from all methods took the approximate form of a negative exponential, with a 3%–4% annual fall rate for snags.

Russell et al. in review at FEM. We review methods for quantifying dead wood in forest ecosystems, withan emphasis on biomass and carbon attributes.Our review similarly identifies key research needs and knowledge which at present impede our ability to accurately characterize dead wood populations.
